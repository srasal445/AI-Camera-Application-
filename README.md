The AI Camera Application is an advanced computer vision project designed to capture and process live video streams in real time. This application utilizes Python and OpenCV as its core technologies, allowing users to interact with their camera seamlessly while integrating AI-based functionalities
📖 Overview

The AI Camera Application is a real-time camera project that captures video from your webcam/device and applies computer vision & AI models for detection, recognition, and analysis.
It can be extended for tasks such as face detection, object recognition, motion tracking, and AR features.

🚀 Features

🎥 Live Camera Feed (using OpenCV or device camera).

🧠 AI/ML Integration for object/face detection.

📸 Capture & save images or frames.

🎞️ Record and save video streams.

🔌 Easily extensible for custom ML models (YOLO, Haar cascades, etc.).

🌍 Cross-platform – works on PC, Raspberry Pi, or cloud environments.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Language: Python

Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, TensorFlow / PyTorch (optional)

Models (optional): YOLO / Haar Cascade / Custom trained models

Interface (optional): Tkinter / Streamlit / Flask for GUI or web view
